## Project Title: Joules Score
### Project Stack: Projects and Algo's
### GitHub Repo Link:
https://github.com/jayomeara/capstone/tree/main/joules_score

## Project Description:
Our total household energy use is not simple to calculate. We provide your household Joule Rating®.

- Comprehensive energy tracker and use assesment.
- Convert total energy consumption to Joules/Month aka Joule Rating®
- Color ranking based on fossil fuel consumption
- Yearly energy cost including vehicals

## New Programming Concepts:
Django deployment, third party API.

## Week 1 Features:
website designed, login and registration, basic information capture, overall score designed

## Week 2 Features:

API integration, launch on e2

## Beyond Week 2...
- API to pull solar data based on zip code for solar options
- Cost per kWh per source.
- Cost increase with renuable sources
- Cost savings based on switch to electric vehical
- Smart grid high cost vs low cost energy use comparision
- Historical weather data for year over year energy use
- Comparision to other homes in database
- Air travel and other forms on consumption
- Efficency score based on sq/ft, people in the house, miles traveled, ect...


## Energy Use categories:
- Home Energy Use
- Natural Gas/Oil Use (Therms => kWh)
- Car consumption (avg mpg/miles per year)

## Conversions:
- 1 Therm = 29.3072 kWh
- 1 Gallon Gas = 33.410 kWh
- 1 GJ (gigajoule) = 0.0036 X kWh
