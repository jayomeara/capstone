### GitHub Repo Link:
https://github.com/jayomeara/capstone/tree/main/joules_score

## Project Description:
Our total household energy use is not simple to calculate. We provide your household Joule Rating®.

- Provides 12 months of energy use review.
– Database: User - House - Vehicle - monthUse
- Show 12 month energy info on graph/table
- Summary of yearly energy use as a 'score' (likely gigajoules/day use)

## New Programming Concepts:
Django deployment, launched on aws, SQL relationships (one user to multiple homes/cars, one user to multiple months)

## Week 1 Features:
website designed, login and registration, basic information capture, CRUD commands working

## Week 2 Features:

API integration, launch on e2, score calculated

## Beyond Week 2...
- Cost per kWh per source.
- API: Historical weather data for year over year energy use
- Comparison to other homes in database

## Energy Use categories:
- Home Energy Use
- Natural Gas/Oil Use (Therms => kWh)
- Car consumption (avg mpg/miles per year)

## Conversions:
- 1 Therm = 29.3072 kWh
- 1 Gallon Gas = 33.410 kWh
- 1 GJ (gigajoule) = 0.0036 kWh
