# Coding Dojo Capstone Project Proposal #1

• Comprehensive energy use tracker and use assesment.
• Convert total energy consumption to kWh/yr
• Percentage score based on fossil fuel consumption
• Yearly energy cost including vehicals


## Energy Use categories:
• Home Energy Use
• Natural Gas/Oil Use (Therms => kWh)
• Car consumption (avg mpg/miles per year)

## Conversions:
• 1 Therm = 29.3072 kWh
• 1 Gallon Gas = 33.410 kWh
• Joules

## Reach Goals:
• API to pull solar data based on zip code for solar options
• Cost per kWh per source.
• Cost increase with renuable sources
• Cost savings based on switch to electric vehical
• Smart grid high cost vs low cost energy use comparision
• Historical weather data for year over year energy use
• Comparision to other homes in database
• Air travel and other forms on consumption
• Efficency score based on sq/ft, people in the house, miles traveled, ect...
